Here the upper left 3 x 3 matrix describes a rotation, reflection, scaling or shear (or any combination of) and the 4th column a translation. This 4 x 4 matrix must be supplied as a 4 x 4 numpy array. Any number of transforms can be concatenated together to give the final position. Helper functions for rotations, translations and scalings are provided in zutil.transform. An example is given below:
