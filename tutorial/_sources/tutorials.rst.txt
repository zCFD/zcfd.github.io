zCFD Tutorials
==============

The following sections are step-by-step guides to running zCFD on different test cases. All are freely available to download.

Getting zCFD
------------

The first step for any of the cases is to download and install zCFD. This can be done in one of two ways, if you are running Linux/Unix zCFD is provided as a stand-alone tarball containing all the packages required to run this can be downloaded from the `zCFD website <https://zcfd.zenotech.com/>`_. If you are running Windows or MacOS zCFD is provided in a Docker container which allows you to run the solver inside a CentOS container, this can be downloaded from `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/zcfd/zcfd>`_. Details of these two installation methods are given below:

Linux Install
-------------

Once the zCFD tarball has downloaded simply untar it and install the license file provided over email

.. code-block:: shell

    $ tar -zxvf zCFD-icc-sse-impi-2019.01.68-Linux-64bit.tar.gz

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cp zcfd.lic /path/to/zCFD/lic/.

Once zCFD has been installed the zCFD environment needs to be activated:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ source /path/to/zCFD/bin/activate
    (zCFD)$

These steps are shown in the asciicast below

Docker Container Install
------------------------

First download and install `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_ then pull the zcfd container

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker login registry.zenotech.com
    $ docker pull registry.zenotech.com/zcfd/zcfd/run/centos7/ompi

Run the container mounting your home directory and starting a bash shell. Raised ptrace privileges are required for mpi to function correctly

.. code-block:: shell

    # Start a Docker container mounting you home directory as /home/zcfd/home
    # On windows replace $HOME with /c/Users/USERNAME

    $ docker run -it --rm  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp:unconfined -p 8888:8888 -v $HOME:/home/zcfd/home zcfd/run/centos7/ompi /bin/bash

    # Use ^D or exit to exit the container

Once the image has been pulled from the repository the first two steps can be ignored and the docker run command issued directly.

How to setup and run the docker container is shown in the asciicast below:
