NASA CRM Tutorial
-----------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The NASA Common Research Model (CRM) is representative of a civil aircraft, and has been extensively tested in wind-tunnels and benchmarked for CFD with a series of international workshops. Accurate prediction of the drag components (pressure and friction) for a given configuration exercises the CFD turbulence model and transonic simulation capability.

Conditions

The Drag Prediction Workshop 5 challenge to match a given lift coefficient :math:`C_L` of 0.5 is the basis for this test case. NASA provides a range of meshes with varying cell density, for a mesh refinement study and extrapolation.  We use the Level-3 mesh (L3) for this test case, corresponding to medium density with 5.11 million cells.  The case is run as a steady simulation, with a Menter SST (Vsust) fully-turbulent model. We iterate to find a value for the angle of attack :math:`\alpha` to match the lift coefficient, and then determine the drag coefficient components :math:`C_{D(PR)}` and :math:`C_{D(FR)}` for the pressure and friction components respectively.

Lift Coefficient: :math:`C_L` = 0.5

Pressure: P = 101325 Pascals

Temperature: T = 310.928 Kelvin

Reynolds Number: :math:`Re` = 5.0 x 10 :math:`^{6}`

Mach Number: :math:`M` = 0.85
