--------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The NASA Common Research Model (CRM) is representative of a civil aircraft, and has been extensively tested in wind-tunnels and benchmarked for CFD with a series of international workshops. Accurate prediction of the drag components (pressure and friction) for a given configuration exercises the CFD turbulence model and transonic simulation capability.

Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^

The Drag Prediction Workshop 5 challenge to match a given lift coefficient :math:`C_L` of 0.5 is the basis for this test case. NASA provides a range of meshes with varying cell density, for a mesh refinement study and extrapolation.  We use the Level-3 mesh (L3) for this test case, corresponding to medium density with 5.11 million cells.  The case is run as a steady simulation, with a Menter SST (Vsust) fully-turbulent model. We iterate to find a value for the angle of attack :math:`\alpha` to match the lift coefficient, and then determine the drag coefficient components :math:`C_{D(PR)}` and :math:`C_{D(FR)}` for the pressure and friction components respectively.

Lift Coefficient: :math:`C_L` = 0.5

Pressure: P = 101325 Pascals

Temperature: T = 310.928 Kelvin

Reynolds Number: :math:`Re` = 5.0 x 10 :math:`^{6}`

Mach Number: :math:`M` = 0.85

Mesh
^^^^

The mesh for the NASA CRM test case is available for download here:

.. code-block:: bash

    > wget TODO
    > dpw5_L3.h5

The mesh has been converted from the original file *L3.M.rev01.p3d.hex.r8.ugrid* using :ref:`ugrid_converter`.  This original mesh, and others in the series can be downloaded from the NASA server here: `NASA DPW5 Meshes <ftp://cmb24.larc.nasa.gov/outgoing/DPW5>`_

Input Files
^^^^^^^^^^^

The input file for the NASA CRM Drag Prediction Workshop 5 (DPW5) test case is available for download here:

	Drag Prediction Workshop 5 result comparison. We compare the zCFD results with other CFD codes (Edge, CFD++, FUN3D and MFlow) where data was provided as part of the workshop. The notebook below contains a Python dictionary with this and other comparison data for the workshop, in a `single file <https://github.com/zenotech/zPost/blob/master/ipynb/NASA_CRM/data/DPW5_Comparative_Data.py>`_.

Metric
^^^^^^

The values for several quantities are automatically checked against the Drag Prediction Workshop 5 values (bounded by one standard deviation for the results submitted) as part of the verification process:

Angle of Attack:             :math:`\alpha`     = 2.20000 :math:`\pm` 0.05000 degrees

Lift Coefficient:            :math:`C_{L}`      = 0.50000 :math:`\pm` 0.00500

Drag Coefficient:            :math:`C_{D}`      = 0.02502 :math:`\pm` 0.00062

Drag Coefficient (Pressure): :math:`C_{D(PR)}`  = 0.01400 :math:`\pm` 0.00050

Drag Coefficient (Friction): :math:`C_{D(FR)}`  = 0.01100 :math:`\pm` 0.00075
