source/reference_guide/overset.rst:76: (th)   is set to 0, this provides a 0th order interpolation where we only utilise data from cell a mapped point is located within.  If set to 1, a first order interpolation is achieved using an IDW interpolation, using the cell a point is found in, and its neighbours.
