source/reference_guide/intro.rst:12: (booleans)  zCFD will validate the parameters dictionary specified at run time against a set of expected values for each key. In general, values that should be integers and floats will be coerced to the correct type. Values which should be strings, booleans, lists or dictionaries will cause an error if they are the incorrect type. The time marching scheme and solver/equation set chosen defines which dictionary keys are valid. A simple script is provided to allow the user to check the validity of their input parameters before submitting their job. See
