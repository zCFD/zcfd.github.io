Installing zCFD
---------------


Licence
-------


zCFD requires a license.  If you do not already have a license, please contact mailto:zcfd@zenotech.com to obtain one.  The license file provided can be placed in the same directory alongside the input files or else its location can be defined using the environment variables below

.. code-block:: bash

    export RLM_LICENSE=port@server

or

.. code-block:: bash

    export RLM_LICENSE=/path/to/license/file

In the case that the system running the simulation cannot access the internet a local license server will be required. See http://www.reprisesoftware.com/admin/software-licensing.php for details.
