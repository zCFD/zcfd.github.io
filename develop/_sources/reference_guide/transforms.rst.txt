.. _mesh_transform:

Mesh Transformation
-------------------

This dictionary is used to setup an initial deformation of the mesh. Typically a known deformation of a surface in the mesh is propagated out into the volume using either radial basis function or inverse distance weighted interpolation. Deforming an aircraft wing or wind turbine blade to a static load shape are two uses of this functionality.

.. _transform_interpolation:

Interpolation method
====================
Selects the interpolation method used to propagate the surface deformation into the volume mesh. Three methods are available:

**'rbf'** uses the 'greedy' method of `Allan et al <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2009.12.006>`_. where the deformation is started with a subset of points and additional points are added until the surface deformation reaches the requested tolerance. 

**'rbf multiscale'** uses the `multiscale <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2017.05.042>`_ rbf method where a subset of surface points with a fixed support radius are solved implicitly and the remaining points are solved explicitly with a support radius determined as part of the solution process. The fraction of points included in the base set can be set with **'base point fraction'**. The base set of points are assigned the support radius **'alpha'** and hence can have a wider sphere of influence than the remaining points which are used in the multiscale process.

.. note::

    Increasing the number of points in the base set and/or increasing alpha generally makes the surface deformation propagate further into the volume mesh reducing the likelihood of generating poor quality cells 

**'idw'** uses a simple inverse distance weighted interpolation.  The **`power`** parameter can provide a list of three exponents used in the IDW scheme. The first (p1) is applied to the interpolation weight of points close to the surface, the second (p2) to points which are the deformation distance away from the surface and the third (p3) is used to blend between the two extremes. 

:math:`wt_1 = (deformation distance / distance)^{p1}`
:math:`wt_2 = (deformation distance / distance)^{p2}` 
:math:`blend = ((deformation distance - distance) / deformation distance)^{p3}`

Then the weight is:

:math:`wt = (wt1 * (1.0 - blend) + blend * wt2)`
