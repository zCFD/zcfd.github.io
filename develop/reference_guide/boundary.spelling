As such, there are fundamental limitations on the accuracy of this model with highly curved surfaces and strong pressure gradients.  This can be alleviated to some extent with mesh refinement, however, this is associated with additional computational cost.
source/reference_guide/boundary.rst:142: (isothermal) ["isotherms", "isotherm", "isotherm's", "geothermal", "thermal"] Specifies the wall temperature for an isothermal wall. If not specified the wall is treated as adiabatic
