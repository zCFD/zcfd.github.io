source/reference_guide/initial.rst:151: (EddyViscosity)  The conditions in the VTK file are specified by node based arrays with names ‘Pressure’, ‘Temperature’, ‘Velocity’, ‘TI’ and ‘EddyViscosity’. Note the field will override the conditions specified previously therefore the user can specify only the conditions that are different from default.
source/reference_guide/initial.rst:212: (csv)  However, the driving function is subsequently provided with key word arguments containing all the data in the ‘_report.csv’ file, evaluated at the previous timestep.
source/reference_guide/initial.rst:213: (csv)  For any driven initial condition, every value in the initial condition dictionary is also appended to the _report.csv file.
source/reference_guide/initial.rst:215: (acheived)  This means that the initial condition can be programmed to respond to the flow. An example is shown below, where the driven IC will continually adjust inlet angle of attack until a specified lift coefficient is acheived.
source/reference_guide/initial.rst:217: (propogate)  If the driven initial condition has been programmed to respond to changes in the flow, it is important to ensure that the flow has had enough time to propogate from the farfield through to the region of interest and settle before readjusting the driven initial condition.
source/reference_guide/initial.rst:218: (propogation)  For simulations where the farfield is distant from the geometry, local and implicit time-stepping will likely give the fastest propogation of adjusted farfield conditions through the domain.
