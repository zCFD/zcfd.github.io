source/reference_guide/time.rst:226: (inegration)  For most of the test cases where Runge-Kutta inegration is used, 5 stages are applied.  This is a typical industry standard and has been shown to be robust for most test cases.
source/reference_guide/time.rst:230: (timestepping)  Global time stepping uses the same time step in each cell for the integration, whereas local time stepping calculates and uses the time step in each cell as determined by the local flow conditions and the prescribed CFL number. In cases where there are very small cells. it would be impractical to use global timestepping as all the cells would have to march at the pace of the slowest.
source/reference_guide/time.rst:233: (timestepping)  While global timestepping restricts all cells to the smallest timestep and should only be used for unsteady simulations.
source/reference_guide/time.rst:271: (timesteps)  (Unsteady only)  For unsteady simulations, how many steady-state timesteps to run to initialise solution.
source/reference_guide/time.rst:302: (timesteps)   provides the option of initialising an unsteady simulation with a number of steady-state pseudo timesteps.
source/reference_guide/time.rst:307: (captue)  The unsteady laminar cylinder test case sheds a vortex street with a specific Strouhal number. We want to run the simulation for 1.7 seconds to allow the oscillation to begin and establish a well-formed pattern. We set the time step to a small enough value to captue the unsteady shedding phenomenon.
source/reference_guide/time.rst:323: (timesteps)  The example below uses a relatively large time step and maintains accuracy with a second order integration scheme. The case starts with 2000 pseudo-timesteps before starting the unsteady simulation.

The time step limitation on the lower order polynomials is less restrictive that for the higher order polynomials and hence information corresponding to longer wavelengths may be more efficintly propaged in the fluid domain.
