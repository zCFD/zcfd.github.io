source/reference_guide/fluid_zone.rst:14: (behavior) ["behaviour", "behaviours", "behave", "Beauvoir", "behaving", "behaviour's", "behove", "heavier", "beaver", "behaved", "behaves"] Each block corresponds to a specific fluid zone within the simulation domain and is identified by a unique key (e.g., ‘FZ_1’). The properties within each block specify the type of zone (such as translating, rotating, porous, disc, or canopy) and the relevant parameters required for that zone type. These parameters control the physical behavior and characteristics of the fluid zone, such as velocity vectors, resistance factors, geometric definitions, and other model-specific settings.
