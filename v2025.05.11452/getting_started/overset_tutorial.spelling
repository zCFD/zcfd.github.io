source/getting_started/overset_tutorial.rst:16: (cityscape) ["Netscape", "seascape", "soundscape", "sideswipe", "setscrew", "sidestep", "setsquare", "stethoscope", "stopgap"] There may already be a high quality mesh for an aircraft or a cityscape, and we want to include a new component or a new building without regenerating the entire mesh. It may be simpler to include any changes into a new mesh of a small region, and apply it like a patch as an overset mesh.
source/getting_started/overset_tutorial.rst:32: (oversetmulticylinder)  There are 4 (mesh, control dictionary) pairs of input files.  These are listed in a special “override” file called “oversetmulticylinder.py” used for overset cases:
source/getting_started/overset_tutorial.rst:41: (oversets) ["overseas", "oversees", "over sets", "over-sets", "overeats", "overseers", "overstays", "oversteps", "overstep", "overheats", "oversells", "oversights", "Orestes", "offsets", "overseer's", "overstates", "Everest's", "overcasts", "overdoses", "oversight's", "overdose's", "offset's", "overcast's", "overset"] Note that in this case, the “back3.h5” mesh defining a cylinder has been used twice.  This is OK, because the “back3.py” and “back4.py” control dictionaries each apply a different transformation (down and up along the y-axis respectively).  The solver knows that the meshes are used for different solutions, in different parts of the flow domain.  Also note that the translated mesh for “back4” overlaps the translated mesh for “back3” (the mesh between the two cylinders). This is also OK because the solver knows that “back4” oversets “back3”, which oversets “back2” and “back1”.  In each case, the active solution is the one on the top-level oversetting mesh.

source/getting_started/overset_tutorial.rst:67: (oversetmulticylinder)  The usual command line arguments specifying the mesh and the case name are not required as they are replaced with the list in the “override” dictionary specified within the “oversetmulticylinder.py” file.
source/getting_started/overset_tutorial.rst:80: (analyze) ["analyse", "analyser", "analysed", "analyses", "ablaze", "analyst", "anally", "analysers", "anal", "annals", "inlays", "unlace", "Alyce", "analysis", "inlay's", "annals's", "reanalyse", "analyser's"] Where the [1,2,3,4] indicates that the file or directory exists for each overset solution separately.   From a post-processing perspective, overset grids offer a significant advantage: independent solutions that only exchange boundary data during computation. This independence can save post-processing time and memory, as not all solution files are needed to analyze specific regions. However, a separate step is necessary to combine these independent solutions for domain-wide processing, such as extracting cross-sections. ParaView can be used to illustrate this combination process.
source/getting_started/overset_tutorial.rst:92: (AppendDatasets) ["Append Datasets", "Append-Datasets", "Appendicitis's", "Appendices", "Appendicitis", "Appendixes", "Antedates", "Aftertastes", "Aftertaste's"] Highlight all 4 files on the navigation tree (on the left) and select “Filters > Append Datasets”.  This will create a new item in the navigation tree called “AppendDatasets1” that acts on all four datasets at once.
source/getting_started/overset_tutorial.rst:94: (AppendDatasets) ["Append Datasets", "Append-Datasets", "Appendicitis's", "Appendices", "Appendicitis", "Appendixes", "Antedates", "Aftertastes", "Aftertaste's"] The volumetric data output for this case contains a variable called “overset” which is 0 or 1 for any cell in the meshes. 0 means that the cell has been overset by another mesh, and 1 means that the cell is the active cell in that location.  Use the “Filters > Threshold” filter to select only the cells in the “AppendDatasets1” combined dataset that have an “overset” value of 1 (do this by changing the lower threshold value from 0 to 1).  This will create a new item in the navigation tree called “Threshold1” excluding any cells that have been overset by cells in another mesh.

These values are used to validate the simulation.
