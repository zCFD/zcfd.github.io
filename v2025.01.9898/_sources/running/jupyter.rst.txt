Using Jupyter
-------------

We also recommend the use of  `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ for post-processing zCFD runs. This is one of the easiest ways to use Python, via an interactive notebook on your local computer. The notebook is a locally hosted server that you can access via a web-browser. 
Jupyter is included in the zCFD distribution and notebooks for visualising the residual data will automatically be created when you run a zCFD case.

To automatically start up notebook server on your computer within the zCFD environment run:

.. code-block:: bash

    start_lab

The output of the command will include the URL to Juypter is running on, simply copy and paste this into your browser to connect to Juypter.
To stop Juypter use *Ctrl + c* in the terminal where Juypter is running.
