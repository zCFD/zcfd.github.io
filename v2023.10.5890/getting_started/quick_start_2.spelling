The .h5 mesh file was generated with units of inches, whereas the flow conditions are specified in SI units, therefore a scaling of 0.0254 is applied to convert the mesh into metres. The z (spanwise) direction has been scaled to be 1 metre wide. The mesh has only a single cell in the z direction so no spanwise flow is expected - making the z extent of the mesh 1 metre simply means that the forces and moments reported by zCFD will already be per unit span.
